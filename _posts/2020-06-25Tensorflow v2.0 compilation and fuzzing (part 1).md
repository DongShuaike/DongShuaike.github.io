## Tensorflow v2.0 compilation and fuzzing (part 1)



Recently I was working on a new project around **deep learning framework fuzzing** which seems very exciting. I choose **Tensorflow** as the target since its complexity and variety of components appear to be more **vulnerable :-)**.

The figure below shows the whole architecture of Tensorflow. From it we know what we usually use in normal days are only a small part of the whole system (mainly **Python client**). To make the fuzzing deeper, I decide to target Tensorflow low-level functions, especially **C APIs** and those **kernel implementations**.

The first thing to do is compilation of source code, during which I can get familiar with overall structure of Tensorflow and learn how to play with its C-implemented interfaces. However, the journey  was not smooth.

In this post I will record all "holes" I got stuck at and "ad hoc" way to solve them. I hope my solution can help those also compiling Tensorflow. Since I have **no GPUs** on my poor PC, I take the CPU-version instead and  unaware of GPU-related issues.

### Let's start 

#### Tested build configurations

[Tested build configurations ]: 	"https://www.tensorflow.org/install/source#linux "

The first and most important reference I should mention is the tested build configuration page on Tensorflow's official website. One of my bad experiences is to copy the procedures on a `gcc-7.5` PC to a `gcc-9.3` laptop.  You are recommended to make your environment consistent to ones tested by the official. For me, it is `bazel 0.26.1`+`Python 3.6` + `tensorflow 2.0.0`. (ubuntu 18.04)

#### bazel workspace.bzl file

Google has changed its default building tool from cmake to their own **bazel**. I spent sometime getting familiarized with its syntax.  Each project built with bazel should have a file called `workspace.bzl` . Inside it listed **how to acquire other projects' sources.**  Below I copies some code snippets of it, which are about the `eigen` library, a very famous C++ template library for linear algebra.

```python
    tf_http_archive(
        name = "eigen_archive",
        build_file = clean_dep("//third_party:eigen.BUILD"),
        patch_file = clean_dep("//third_party/eigen3:gpu_packet_math.patch"),
        sha256 = "f3d69ac773ecaf3602cb940040390d4e71a501bb145ca9e01ce5464cf6d4eb68",
        strip_prefix = "eigen-eigen-049af2f56331",
        urls = [
            "https://storage.googleapis.com/mirror.tensorflow.org/bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/049af2f56331.tar.gz",
            "https://bitbucket.org/eigen/eigen/get/049af2f56331.tar.gz",
        ],
    )
```

 Although there are materials saying `bazel build` will automatically install all needed external and third-party dependencies listed in `tensorflow/tensorflow/workspace.bzl`, I fail to reach that (due to the unfamiliarity with bazel I think). **will update this part once I fix it.**

#### Setup before bazel building

1. Python and Tensorflow package dependencies.

   ```python
   sudo apt install python-dev python-pip # python3-dev and python3-pip
   pip install -U --user pip six numpy wheel setuptools mock 'future>=0.17.1'
   pip install -U --user keras_applications --no-deps
   pip install -U --user keras_preprocessing --no-deps
   ```

   If you are careless and forgot to install **keras\*** related dependencies above, you will get following errors when you are building python `.whl`  files (`bazel build //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package`). 

   ```python
   ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'keras_preprocessing'
   Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package failed to build
   Use --verbose_failures to see the command lines of failed build steps
   
   ```

2. Google protocol buffers

   [Protocol Buffers]:https://developers.google.com/protocol-buffers	"Protocol Buffers "

   are Google's serializing libraries. It is widely-used in Tensorflow project due to its fascinating **code generation** feature. You have to install it before compiling Tensorflow. To notice, **you'd better install the version listed in `workspace.bzl` file** . For me, it is

   ```python
    PROTOBUF_URLS = [
           "https://storage.googleapis.com/mirror.tensorflow.org/github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/archive/310ba5ee72661c081129eb878c1bbcec936b20f0.tar.gz",
           "https://github.com/protocolbuffers/protobuf/archive/310ba5ee72661c081129eb878c1bbcec936b20f0.tar.gz",
       ]
       PROTOBUF_SHA256 = "b9e92f9af8819bbbc514e2902aec860415b70209f31dfc8c4fa72515a5df9d59"
       PROTOBUF_STRIP_PREFIX = "protobuf-310ba5ee72661c081129eb878c1bbcec936b20f0"
   ```

   Copy the URL and `wget` it, then follow the `ReadMe` file to install it to your system. Finally, the protobuf libraries will be installed to `/usr/local/lib`.

3. Eigen library

   Different from protocol buffers, we don't need to `make` and `make install` Eigen library. Just download the needed version and decompress it to a folder. Add the path involving `eigen3` to the environment variable `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH` like below:

   ```bash
   export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$HOME/Tools/include/:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
   export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="$HOME/Tools/include/eigen3/:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
   ```

   The structure of `eigen3` folder is like

   ```bash
   âžœ  include ls eigen3           
   bench            COPYING.README        INSTALL
   blas             CTestConfig.cmake     lapack
   cmake            CTestCustom.cmake.in  README.md
   CMakeLists.txt   debug                 scripts
   COPYING.BSD      demos                 signature_of_eigen3_matrix_library
   COPYING.GPL      doc                   test
   COPYING.LGPL     Eigen                 unsupported
   COPYING.MINPACK  eigen3.pc.in
   COPYING.MPL2     failtest
   ```

   If you meet the error `... Partial template specialization is not more specialized thant primary template ...`, please take a look at the solution [xcode 9 falls to build partial template specialization in c](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46356153/xcode-9-falls-to-build-partial-template-specialization-in-c/46382971). I tested the last answer manually and it worked.

   To conclude, you should do following modifications (Assume you put eigen3 folder in `/usr/include`):

   In the file `/usr/include/eigen3/unsupported/Eigen/CXX11/src/Tensor/TensorStorage.h`, change the old** style to **new** style:

   **Old**:

   ```c
   template<typename T, int Options_, typename FixedDimensions>
   class TensorStorage<T, FixedDimensions, Options_>
   {
   ```

   **New**:

   ```c
   template<typename T, typename FixedDimensions, int Options_>      // swap the templ params to match the declaration
   class TensorStorage                                               // drop the specialization (because it didn't!)
   {
   ```

4. abseil library

   Another library you should involve is [abseil-cpp](https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp) . `git clone` this project and put it under the root of Tensorflow (where you have another `tensorflow` subfolder, `third_party` and `tools`). Also note to add a soft link to it.

   ```bash
   $ git clone https://github.com/abseil/abseil-cpp.git
   $ ln -s abseil-cpp/absl ./absl
   ```

   Without abseil library, you may meet the error saying something like `fatal error: absl/strings/string_view.h: No such file or directory`.

   The solution is provided in the following thread:

   [Newly included absl headers are missing from the include path](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/22007)

### Build it!

To test C implementations in Tensorflow, we need to get some **shared library files**, in my case, **tensorflow.so**, **tensorflow_cc.so** and **tensorflow_framework.so**. All the descriptions of these three libraries are listed in `tensorflow/tensorflow/BUILD` file. Reading the `deps` part you will have a rough idea of what are those libraries for. 

`libtensorflow.so`:

```python
tf_cc_shared_object(
    name = "tensorflow",
    linkopts = select({
        "//tensorflow:macos": [
            "-Wl,-exported_symbols_list,$(location //tensorflow/c:exported_symbols.lds)",
        ],
        "//tensorflow:windows": [
        ],
        "//conditions:default": [
            "-z defs",
            "-Wl,--version-script,$(location //tensorflow/c:version_script.lds)",
        ],
    }),
    per_os_targets = True,
    soversion = VERSION,
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    # add win_def_file for tensorflow
    win_def_file = select({
        # We need this DEF file to properly export symbols on Windows
        "//tensorflow:windows": ":tensorflow_filtered_def_file",
        "//conditions:default": None,
    }),
    deps = [
        "//tensorflow/c:c_api",
        "//tensorflow/c:c_api_experimental",
        "//tensorflow/c:exported_symbols.lds",
        "//tensorflow/c:version_script.lds",
        "//tensorflow/c/eager:c_api",
        "//tensorflow/core:tensorflow",
        "//tensorflow/core/distributed_runtime/rpc:grpc_session",
    ],
)

```

`libtensorflow_cc.so`

```python
tf_cc_shared_object(
    name = "tensorflow_cc",
    linkopts = select({
        "//tensorflow:macos": [
            "-Wl,-exported_symbols_list,$(location //tensorflow:tf_exported_symbols.lds)",
        ],
        "//tensorflow:windows": [],
        "//conditions:default": [
            "-z defs",
            "-Wl,--version-script,$(location //tensorflow:tf_version_script.lds)",
        ],
    }),
    per_os_targets = True,
    soversion = VERSION,
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    # add win_def_file for tensorflow_cc
    win_def_file = select({
        # We need this DEF file to properly export symbols on Windows
        "//tensorflow:windows": ":tensorflow_filtered_def_file",
        "//conditions:default": None,
    }),
    deps = [
        "//tensorflow:tf_exported_symbols.lds",
        "//tensorflow:tf_version_script.lds",
        "//tensorflow/c:c_api",
        "//tensorflow/c/eager:c_api",
        "//tensorflow/cc:cc_ops",
        "//tensorflow/cc:client_session",
        "//tensorflow/cc:scope",
        "//tensorflow/cc/profiler",
        "//tensorflow/core:tensorflow",
    ] + if_ngraph(["@ngraph_tf//:ngraph_tf"]),
)

```

`libtensorflow_framework.so`

```python
tf_cc_shared_object(
    name = "tensorflow_framework",
    framework_so = [],
    linkopts = select({
        "//tensorflow:macos": [],
        "//tensorflow:windows": [],
        "//tensorflow:freebsd": [
            "-Wl,--version-script,$(location //tensorflow:tf_framework_version_script.lds)",
            "-lexecinfo",
        ],
        "//conditions:default": [
            "-Wl,--version-script,$(location //tensorflow:tf_framework_version_script.lds)",
        ],
    }),
    linkstatic = 1,
    per_os_targets = True,
    soversion = VERSION,
    visibility = ["//visibility:public"],
    deps = [
        "//tensorflow/cc/saved_model:loader_lite_impl",
        "//tensorflow/core:core_cpu_impl",
        "//tensorflow/core:framework_internal_impl",
        "//tensorflow/core:gpu_runtime_impl",
        "//tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers:custom_graph_optimizer_registry_impl",
        "//tensorflow/core:lib_internal_impl",
        "//tensorflow/stream_executor:stream_executor_impl",
        "//tensorflow:tf_framework_version_script.lds",
    ] + tf_additional_binary_deps(),
```

The commands to build them three are :

```
bazel build //tensorflow:tensorflow
bazel build //tensorflow:tensorflow_cc
bazel build //tensorflow:tensorflow_framework
```

After around 1~2 hours (depends on your hardware), you will get these three shared library objects in `tensorflow/bazel-bin/tensorflow`.

### Build python `.whl` binary

If you want to compile the python interfaces as well, you need to run 

```bash
bazel build //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package
# wait for its completion
./bazel-bin/tensorflow/tools/pip_package/build_pip_package /tmp/tensorflow_pkg
```

If everything is fine, you will find a `*.whl` file in `/tmp/tensorflow_pkg`. Use `pip install *.whl` to install it and enjoy.

### Other weird issues

If you have managed the above, congratulations! Now you can link them and write your own C programs. However, when I "migrated" my above procedures to one of my laptops, I met other issues. I will list them by errors.

1. Check your GCC version

   When I was running `bazel build //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package`, I got following errors:

   ```
   ERROR: /home/dsk/Alipay/tensorflow/tensorflow/core/platform/BUILD:98:1: undeclared inclusion(s) in rule '//tensorflow/core/platform:cpu_info':
   
   this rule is missing dependency declarations for the following files included by 'tensorflow/core/platform/cpu_info.cc':
     'absl/base/log_severity.h'
     'absl/base/attributes.h'
     'absl/base/config.h'
     'absl/base/options.h'
     'absl/base/policy_checks.h'
     'absl/strings/string_view.h'
     'absl/base/internal/throw_delegate.h'
     'absl/base/macros.h'
     'absl/base/optimization.h'
     'absl/base/port.h'
   Target //tensorflow/tools/pip_package:build_pip_package failed to build
   Use --verbose_failures to see the command lines of failed build steps.
   
   ```

   I spent a lot of time fixing this and finally find the **inconsistent gcc(g++) version** led to this. Then I downgraded gcc with following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get install -y software-properties-common
   sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ubuntu-toolchain-r/test
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install g++-7 -y
   sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/gcc gcc /usr/bin/gcc-7 60 \
                            --slave /usr/bin/g++ g++ /usr/bin/g++-7 
   sudo update-alternatives --config gcc
   ```

   Also, don't forget to put the new GCC's `include` path to the environment variable

   In your `~/.bashrc`, add the following:

   ```bash
   export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH="/usr/lib/gcc/x86_64-linux-gnu/7/include/:$CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH"
   ```

   Now build again.

2. grpc issue

   If you met the following error:

   ```bash
   ERROR: /home/dsk/.cache/bazel/_bazel_dsk/34dcb22fe3c9a03150797364c441c079/external/grpc/BUILD:507:1: C++ compilation of rule '@grpc//:gpr_base' failed (Exit 1)
   external/grpc/src/core/lib/gpr/log_linux.cc:43:13: error: ambiguating new declaration of 'long int gettid()'
      43 | static long gettid(void) { return syscall(__NR_gettid); }
   ```

   Try the following solution, I got this from [Build tensorflow error as "external/grpc/src/core/lib/gpr/log_linux.cc:43:13: error: ambiguating new declaration of 'long int gettid()'"](https://github.com/clearlinux/distribution/issues/1151).

   Step 1. 

   ```bash
   cd tensorflow
   wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/clearlinux-pkgs/tensorflow/master/Add-grpc-fix-for-gettid.patch
   patch -p1 <Add-grpc-fix-for-gettid.patch
   ```

   Step 2.

   ```bash
   wget https://nomeroff.net.ua/tf/Rename-gettid-functions.patch
   cp ./Rename-gettid-functions.patch ./third_party/Rename-gettid-functions.patch
   ```

   

   ### Conclusion

   The compilation is not easy and I really think the introduction section on the Tensorflow official website is somewhat too abbreviate. I hope this post can help you and in the next post, I will introduce some of my practice of fuzzing Tensorflow source code.
